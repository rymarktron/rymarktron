Hi there, I'm RyanðŸ‘‹

Throughout my life, I have been a problem solver. It all started with math contest in my elementary years and playing chess. From there, it grew with larger group projects and involvements in organizations, such as Scouts Canada.

During the day, I am either studying engineering at the great University of Waterloo in the Mechatronics Engineering programming, or interning at a company. Now, I get to solve real-life problems which is always exciting!

Currently, I am working on a major website for my Scouts group and a project for the engineering orientation week.
