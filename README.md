Hi, I'm RyanðŸ‘‹

I have always been drawn to problem-solving, starting with math contests and chess during my elementary school years. This fascination with finding solutions has continued to grow throughout my life, as I have taken on group projects and leadership roles in organizations like the University of Waterloo Engineering Society and Scouts Canada.

By day, I am either studying Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo, working on personal projects, or collaborating with a design team. These experiences allow me to apply my problem-solving skills to real-life challenges, which I find extremely exciting.

Currently, I am working on a major website for my Scouts group and a project for the engineering orientation week at my university.
