Hi, I'm Ryan👋

I have had a lifelong passion for problem-solving, starting from my participation in math and chess competitions during my elementary school years. This interest has only continued to deepen as I have taken on more group projects and leadership roles in organizations such as the UW Space Soldering design team where I led the engineering design of the space soldering centrifuge and got to fly in microgravity with the experiment.

During my days, I am wrapping up my studies in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. What occupies my time is building Quantoflow, the next AML software to help reduce false positives in industries and empower AML teams 🚒️‍🔥!
